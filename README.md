# The SoundCloud Client

## Introduction

A project, outlined in several articles by Robin Wieruch, that covers how to create your own React development environment from scratch (as opposed to using boilerplate, e.g. create-react-app), create a SoundCloud client using React and Redux, and finally how to convert the state management engine from Redux to MobX.

## Getting Started

In order to get started and learn about the necessary JavaScript "tooling", Robin suggests reading and implementing a basic React development environment: https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/.
