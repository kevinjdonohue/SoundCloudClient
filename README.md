# SoundCloud Client Tutorial

## Introduction

This is an implementation of a project tutorial, outlined in several articles by [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de), that covers how to create your own React development environment from scratch (as opposed to using boilerplate, e.g. [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)), create a [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) client using React and Redux, and finally how to convert the state management engine from Redux to MobX.
